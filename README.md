# symbiont-sra
Data from [Gerth & Hurst 2017](https://github.com/gerthmicha/symbiont-sra/)

This repository was created to enable interested readers to reproduce the steps described in [Gerth & Hurst 2017](https://github.com/gerthmicha/symbiont-sra/). A guide for the steps used to retrieve *Apis* SRA data, and to extract microbial information is given in [guide.md](https://github.com/gerthmicha/symbiont-sra/blob/master/guide.md). All intermediate files that were created using the outlined steps are also found in this repository, and are described in [guide.md](https://github.com/gerthmicha/symbiont-sra/blob/master/guide.md). 

Other files in this repository: 
+ two alignment files created with [SSU-ALIGN](http://eddylab.org/software/ssu-align/) for *Lactobacillus* 16S phylogenetic analysis
+ assembly files created with [PROKKA](https://github.com/tseemann/prokka) (.gff, .gbk, .fsa) for three novel draft genomes of *Apis* symbionts recovered in our analyses.
